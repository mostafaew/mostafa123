    <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>
    <p>Dinosaurs are a group of extinct reptiles that lived on land during the Mesozoic Era12. They had upright limbs and were carnivorous or herbivorous12. Dinosaurs are classified into two main groups: ornithischians and saurischians, based on their pelvic structure1. Dinosaurs are also defined as the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Triceratops and modern birds3.</p>
